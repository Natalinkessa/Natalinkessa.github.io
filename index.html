<p>If you're <strong>involved in an internet marketing business,</strong> then
	you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
	enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

<p>What you <b>need to know is that "Time Is Money".</b> And this
	applies even more to the online world, than in regular
	business.</p>

<p>You see, <em>anyone can become an online entrepreneur.</em> It
	doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
	start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

<p>And since <i>cash isn't really a barrier,</i> time-management has
	become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
	simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

<p>So what<sup>2</sup> are the great<sub>est</sub> online time wasters and what can
	you do to avoid them?</p>

<h2>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</h2>
<hr>

<p>This sounds simple. <cite>But stop and think how many</cite> times you
	retype the same old simple information.</p>

<p>Most people have <abbr title="Abbbrtr Best Best Super Quiq">ABBSQ</abbr>cottoned on to automating their email
	signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
	communicating words quickly.</p>

<p>Get yourself <small>a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
		enable you to write much faster and prevent</small> you from ever
	having to type the same thing twice.</p>

<p>I use this utility http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot , but
	there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
	available.</p>

<h2>Failing to manage your email effectively.</h2>
<hr>

<p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
	be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
	own installed on your computer.</p>

<p>i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
	set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
	trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
	emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
	into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
	through them afterwards and pull back any that have
	been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p>
<p>ii. Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
	organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
	FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more. </p>
